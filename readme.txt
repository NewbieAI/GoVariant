A simple application designed to showcase the ability to write some useful code. 

This project contains a custom implementation of the board game Go by introducing a new flavor. If you are unfamiliar with rules of Go, a quick Google search can help. The idea behind this new variant is to introduce non-perfect information elements into the classical game, by hiding the most recent move played by the opponent. If you correctly predicted, or simply by good luck guessed, the last move played by the opponent, then you can play a stone at the same location, which will nullify your opponent's last move.

The idea is to enable small-scale online testing, so the application will connect to a web server. At the point of its creation, not commercial use is planned for the project, so it will only support very small number of concurrent players.
